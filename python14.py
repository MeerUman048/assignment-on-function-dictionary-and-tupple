# Start with an empty dictionary and perform the following operations in order: 
#1. Add 3 key-value pairs. 
#2. Update the score of one student. 
#3. Remove a student from the dictionary. 
#4. Use the get() method to retrieve a value safely. 
# Step 1: Create an empty dictionary
students_scores = {}

# Add 3 key-value pairs
students_scores["Alice"] = 85
students_scores["Bob"] = 92
students_scores["Charlie"] = 78
print("After adding 3 students:", students_scores)

# Step 2: Update the score of one student (e.g., Alice)
students_scores["Alice"] = 90
print("After updating Alice's score:", students_scores)
